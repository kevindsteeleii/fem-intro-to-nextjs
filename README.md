### The purpose of this repo:
This repo is a record of working through the Front End Masters Next.js Introductory course by [Scott Moss AKA Hendrixer](https://github.com/Hendrixer) and another step on my way to becoming a more confident, well-rounded full-stack engineer.

### Course Description:
> Next.js is a complete full-stack framework built on top of React.js. You can use Next.js to create static sites like blogs and documentation websites to even full-blown, full-stack applications, and APIs. In this course, you'll learn server-side rendering, static site generation, data fetching, build API endpoints, creating pages with the file system, add CSS modules inside of Next.js, and much more!
